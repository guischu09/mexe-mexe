WebSocket Game Server Architecture Summary
Project Context
Building a turn-based card game server in Go with WebSocket connections. The architecture emphasizes clean separation of concerns with independent, swappable components.
Core Design Philosophy

Game engine is transport-agnostic: Uses InputProvider and OutputProvider interfaces so it can work with WebSockets, CLI, AI, etc.
Independent components: Each part (server, game engine, connection handling) has clear responsibilities
Interface-driven: Game engine works with abstractions, not concrete implementations

Architecture Flow
1. Connection & Lobby Phase (Server Responsibility)
Client â†’ WebSocket â†’ Server.HandleConnections()
â”œâ”€â”€ Read JoinServerMessage 
â”œâ”€â”€ Authenticate user
â”œâ”€â”€ Send WelcomeMessage
â”œâ”€â”€ Read StartGameMessage  
â”œâ”€â”€ Create/join GameRoom
â””â”€â”€ When room full (2 players) â†’ Start game
2. Game Handoff (Critical Transition)
Server creates:
â”œâ”€â”€ engine.Game (with shuffled player order)
â”œâ”€â”€ WebsocketInputProvider for each client  
â”œâ”€â”€ WebsocketOutputProvider for each client
â””â”€â”€ Calls room.StartGame() â†’ game.Start() in goroutine
Key Issue Resolved: Server must stop reading from WebSocket after game starts to avoid conflicts with game engine's input providers.
3. Game Phase (Engine Responsibility)
Game Engine Loop:
â”œâ”€â”€ For each player's turn:
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Call inputProvider.GetPlay() â†’ blocks on WebSocket
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Validate play with IsValid()
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Execute play with MakePlay()
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Update game state
â””â”€â”€ Continue until win/quit condition
Technical Challenge Solved: JSON Interface Serialization
Problem: Cannot directly serialize/deserialize Go interfaces (engine.Play) over JSON.
Solution: Type-based discrimination pattern:
go// Play structs include type field
type DrawCardPlay struct {
    Type string `json:"type"` // "DRAW_CARD"
}

// Server detects type, creates concrete Play
switch detector.Type {
case "DRAW_CARD":
    return engine.NewDrawCardPlay()
// ...
}
Key Components
Game Engine Interface
gotype InputProvider interface {
    GetPlay(Table, Hand, string, TurnState) Play
}

type Play interface {
    GetName() AvailablePlay  // DRAW_CARD, PLAY_MELD, END_TURN, QUIT
    GetCards() []*Card
}
WebSocket Flow

Client sends: {"play": {"type": "DRAW_CARD"}}
Server parses: Creates concrete DrawCardPlay
Engine uses: play.GetName() for game logic

Current State

âœ… Connection handling & lobby system
âœ… Game engine with turn-based logic
âœ… WebSocket input/output providers
âœ… JSON serialization for Play interface
ðŸ”„ Current focus: Testing complete client-server game flow

Attitude & Approach

Pragmatic: Get core functionality working before optimizing
Interface-focused: Keep components loosely coupled
Problem-solving: Address specific technical hurdles (like JSON interfaces) with clean solutions
Iterative: Build and test incrementally, avoiding over-engineering

The human values clean architecture and is methodically building a robust foundation before adding complexity like persistence, reconnection handling, or scaling concerns.
